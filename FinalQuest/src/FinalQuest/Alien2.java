/**
 * Another alien. Slightly tougher. Behavior includes:
 * - Moves in a straight line from right to left
 * - Fires 3 shots to the left (diagonal up/down and straight ahead), once every x seconds
 * - If hit once, it makes a damage sound
 * - If hit twice, it is destroyed (player gains 300 points)
 * - Will fly off the screen to the left if not destroyed
 * - If player collides with it, player is destroyed
