/**
 * Alien child of our sprite class. Controls the AI of our alien.
 * Behavior should be:
 * - swerve up and down as it flies to the left
 * - occasionally fire a laser
 * - be destroyed with 1 hit
 * - be destroyed if it flies off the screen (player gets no points though)
 * - 300 points if destroyed by the player
 * - If player collides with it, player is destroyed
